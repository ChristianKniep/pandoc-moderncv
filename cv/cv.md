## Profile

About Me
: With more than 20 years in the industry I experienced a broad set of different roles (IT Apprentice, System/DevOps/R&D/Release Engineer, Customer Advocate, Solution Architect, Developer Advocate) and different industries with colleagues from all over the world. <br>
I had early exposure to container technology (since Docker v0.7 end of 2014), 12factor principles, and DevOps practises which are deeply rooted in my day-to-day routines. <br>
Futhermore, my experience in different working environments (conservative automobile IT in the 2000s, french R&D in the 2010s, fast paced startup in the 2010s, and the fast growing AWS in the 2020s) allows me to adapt to different cultures and work environments.<br>
I am a strong believer in the power of open source and open standards. I am a passionate advocate of container technology and the convergence of HPC, BigData and AI/ML. I am a regular speaker at conferences and workshops around the globe.

Collaboration & Education
: By giving talks (see below) writing blog posts blog.qnib.org, recording the podcast ' Insert Buzzword' and participating and organising community events, I generate content for others to consume, push myself forward into unknown territory and battle test my believes with every encounter and discussion along the way.

Vision
: The continuum of the placement (on-prem/cloud/edge/iot), the architecture (monolith, microservice, serverless), organisational structures (matrix, hierarchical, loose project) needs the ability to prototype, pivot fast and combine these different dimensions.

Personal Engagements
: I am the co-founder and chair of an NGO promoting my small hometown in Lower Saxony (northern Germany) 'Böddenstedt vernetzt - Verein zur Förderung bürgerschaftlichen Engagemnts e.V.'. It was established in 2021 and interconnects different groups within the local community as well as strenghening the connection to local government and companies to improve the quality of life in the village.

## Employement

Over the course of my career I iterated through a lot of roles in different industries, working cultures, and functions within companies. This experience fosters my adaptive and pro-active work attitude.

**QNIB Solutions**
: After leaving AWS I founded my own company to be able to work on projects I am passionate about.

    06/2023 - today
      ~ **Freelance IT Consultant**,Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin, Germany<br>
      Extending traditional storage w/ MinIO on K8s, Consolidating asset management to JIRA Assets, consult w/ containers in research environment.
    07/2023
      ~ **Tech Due Dilligence**: Im Juli 2023 habe ich ein AI Startup für [EarlyBird Venture Capital](https://earlybird.com/) im Bezug auf die AI Strategie und den Container TechStack evaluiert. Das StartUp entwickelt eine Kubernetes basierte Deployment platform für AI Modelle 'on the edge'.

    05/2022 - today
      ~ **Project Lead MetaHub** After leaving AWS I picked up the project MetaHub to create a container registry to serve optimized container images based on the context of a user. 

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

**AWS**
: I joined AWS as Senior Specialist Solutions Architect for EC2 Spot. After almost a year into the role I moved to the HPC product team as the first member of the newly formed Developer Relations Team for High Performance Computing.

    05/2020 - 04/2022
      ~ **Senior Developer Advocate for HPC/Batch**: For the first 6 month I was the frst and only member (besides my Manager) of the Developer Relations Team for HPC/Batch, which meant to define the role and responsibilities of the team. The role had external components (technical blog post, workshops and youtube videos) and internal facing once (funnel feedback from the field to the product team), collaborate closely with the engineering team within product development to improve existing and create new services.

**Indonesia**
: In 2010 I spent the 3 month semester break working in Indonesia, as I wanted to break out for a bit from the stiffness of big automotive vendor IT.

    07/2010 – 10/2010
      ~ **Lecturer**, Int. Center of Applied Technologies, Bandung, Indonesia.<br>
      I taught UNIX,python, git, LaTeX and networking alongside mentoring on IT graduation projects.

## Projects

This non-exhaustive list of pet-projects I am working on (/ used to work on) reflects how I push myself forward exploring unchartered territory.

2019 - today
: **MetaHub Registry**: MetaHub is an OCI compliant container registry which takes context into account to provide flexibility. [metahub-registry.org](https://frontend.metahub-registry.org/)

2023 - today
: **QNIB Shuffle**: A tool to treat workshop pages like software libraries and generate documentation programatically. It is (loosely) inspired by compose files which allow for reuse of any component and (more importantly) libraries in any programming language. [qnib-golang.gitlab.io/qshuf](https://qnib-golang.gitlab.io/qshuf/index.html)

2022 - today
: **HPC Container Conformance**: A project to consolidate the common sense and best-practises on how HPC containers should be build to suite most HPC centers and how to annotate container images to make them discoverable. [https://qnib.org/blog/2023/01/30/the-hpc-container-conformance-project/](https://blog.qnib.org/blog/2023/01/30/the-hpc-container-conformance-project)

2017 - 2018
: **QFrame**: Inspired by the logging framework Logstash, I created a logging framework written in GOLANG. It takes the same general approach as Logstash (inputs, filters, outputs) but allows for capturing metrics and events. [qnib.org/qframe](https://qnib.org/qframe) / [qnib.org/blog/2017/04/30/melig-logeventmetric-collection-within-containers/](https://qnib.org/blog/2017/04/30/melig-logeventmetric-collection-within-containers/)

2018
: **Doxy**: A docker socket proxy to limit the use of the docker socket - back when it was not possible to do otherwise. [github.com/qnib/doxy](https://github.com/qnib/doxy)

2014 - 2015:
: **QNIB Terminal**: Set of stacks to create a multi-host cluster using Docker container. An important personal shift from VMs (using Packer) to containerized environments. It tought me a lot and had my bang my head against a lot of early teething pains. <br>[qnib.org/blog/category/qnibterminal/](https://qnib.org/blog/category/qnibterminal/)
<br><br>
<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>
