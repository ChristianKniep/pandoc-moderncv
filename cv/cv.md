Profile
======

About me
: I am a practitioner by heart and I learn best by banging my head against a problem from different angles over and over again, while gathering feedback and input from peers and customers.<br>
Over the last almost 20 years I experienced a broad set of different roles ( IT Apprentice, System/DevOps/R&D/Release Engineer, Customer Advocate, Solution Architect, Developer Advocate) and different industries with colleagues from all over the world. <br>

Collaboration & Education
: By giving talks (see below) writing blog posts [blog.qnib.org](http://blog.qnib.org), recording the podcast '[Insert Buzzword](http://www.qnib.org/insert-buzzword)' and participating and organising community events, I generate content for others to consume, push myself forward into unknown surface area or depth and battle test my believes with every encounter and discussion along the way.

Vision
: The continuum of the placement (on-prem/cloud/edge/iot), the architecture (monolith, microservice, serverless), organisational structures (matrix, hierarchical, loose project) needs the ability to prototype, pivot fast and combine these different dimensions. I had early exposure to container technology (since Docker v0.7 end of 2014), 12factor principles and DevOps practises which are deeply rooted in my day-to-day routines.

Employment
===========

Over the course of my career I iterated through a lot of roles in different industries, working cultures and functions within companies. This experience fosters my adaptive and pro-active work attitude.

**Amazon Web Services**
: I joined AWS as Senior Specialist Solutions Architect for EC2 Spot. After almost a year into the role I moved to the HPC Product Team as the first member of the newly formed 'Developer Relations Team for High Performance Computing'. 

    05/2020 - 04/2022
      ~ **Senior Developer Advocate for HPC/Batch**: For the first 6 month I was the frst and only member (besides my Manager) of the Developer Relations Team for HPC/Batch, which meant to define the role and responsibilities of the team. The role had external components (technical blog post, workshops and youtube videos) and internal facing once (funnel feedback from the field to the product team), collaborate closely with the engineering team within product development to improve existing and create new services.

    07/2019 - 04/2020
      ~ **Senior Specialist Solutions Architect EC2 Spot**: As part of the Specialist Solutions Architect Team I was supporting the Account Teams within EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) and beyond to help customers make the most of EC2 Spot. Mainly providing external documentation for customers and colleagues to level up their knowlegde about EC2 Spot. In addition working on Proof-of-Concepts to foster the understanding and funneling feedback to product development in Seattle.
  
**Docker Inc**

    10/2017 - 05/2019
      ~ **Technical Account Manager**: Unlike other companies this role was not focusing on support cases or sales cycles. It turned into being an innovation advisor for the customers I had and advocate their needs internally as well as extrapolate what the customer needs are in the future.

**Playstation Now**
: Within Sony Interactive Entertainment (Gaikai Inc) I led the efforts to containerise the cloud stack of Playstation Now.

    07/2015 - 09/2017

**Locafox GmbH**
: The first experience with startups was a small (10 engineers) startup creating a local-commerce platform.

    12/2014 - 07/2015
      ~ **DevOps Engineer**: During my 6 months I streamlined the development by providing the means for the Developers to split apps into microservices. Improving scalability and testing. This included starting to containerise the stack, implement 12-factor-app best practises, and handling private and public clouds.

**Atos**
: During my two years in Paris I worked in the R&D department for the Bull Exascale Interconnect.

    01/2013 - 10/2014
